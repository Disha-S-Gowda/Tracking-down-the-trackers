# Tracking downt he trackers : A Lightbeam Investigation

In this project, I used **Lightbeam**, a Firefox add-on, to examine how websites track our online behavior. Over three days, I discovered surprising insights into the extent of tracking and its implications.

Tracking Landscape: By visualizing third-party trackers, I found that even everyday sites like Google, Facebook, and YouTube are just the tip of the iceberg. Educational platforms and event sites surprisingly host more trackers.

Unknown Data Collectors: Beyond tech giants, I uncovered lesser-known ad agencies and analytics services like Privacymanager.io and Clarity.ms. These entities collect and share our data without our direct interaction.

Security Risks: Some websites accessing our data are insecure, posing risks to our privacy. Examples include Dis.criteo.com and ads.pubmatic.com, highlighting vulnerabilities in online tracking practices.

Subtle Tracking Methods: I also found that seemingly harmless elements like exclamation marks hide web beacons, used to track user activity covertly.

Through this project, I aimed to raise awareness about the pervasive nature of online tracking and its potential consequences for privacy. By visualizing tracking with Lightbeam, I hope to empower users to make informed choices about their online interactions.
